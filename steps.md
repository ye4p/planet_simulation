Phase 2: Newton’s Gravity (The Physics)In your WM_TIMER or a separate update function, you need to calculate the force of gravity between every object.The Formula: Use Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation:$$F = G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}$$$G$: A gravitational constant. In a simulation, you can just pick a number (like $1.0$ or $6.67$) that makes the orbits look good.$r$: The distance between the two bodies.Direction: The force is a vector pointing from the planet to the sun.Acceleration: Once you have the Force, remember $F = ma$, so $a = F/m$.Integration: Every frame, add the acceleration to the velocity, then add the velocity to the position.
Phase 3: OOP Encapsulation & ResponsibilityRight now, your CelestialBody is a "Plain Old Data" (POD) struct. Let's make it smarter.Make Data Private: Move mass, position, and velocity to a private: section.Add a Constructor: You already started this! Ensure it sets up all initial values.The Update Method: Create a function void Update(double dt) inside the class. It should handle moving the position based on the current velocity.The ApplyForce Method: Create a function void ApplyForce(Vector2D force) that calculates how that force changes the velocity.
Phase 4: The "N-Body" ProblemIn your main loop (inside the timer), you shouldn't just hardcode "Sun" and "Earth."Nested Loops: Use a double for loop to iterate through your BodyList.For every body A, loop through every other body B.Calculate the gravity B exerts on A and update A’s velocity.Note: This allows you to have 10 planets all pulling on each other simultaneously!
Phase 5: Coordinate Mapping & RenderingYour planets are currently just points or single pixels.Screen Centering: Since your Sun is at (0,0), and your window is 1000x800, you need to "offset" the drawing so (0,0) is at the center of the screen (500, 400).Draw a Disk: Create a function DrawDisk(int centerX, int centerY, int radius, uint32_t color). It should use two nested loops (from -radius to +radius) and the circle equation ($x^2 + y^2 \le r^2$) to fill in the pixels.Key C++ Concepts to focus on:Operator Overloading: Finish overloading - and \* for your Vector2D.The explicit Keyword: Use this on your constructor to prevent accidental type conversions.Range-based for loops: Use for (auto& body : BodyList) to keep your code clean.Const Correctness: Mark your getter functions (like getPosition()) as const.
